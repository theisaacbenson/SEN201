# Student Management System (SMS)

## Project Overview
The Student Management System is designed to manage student records such as adding, viewing, and deleting student information in an organized manner.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The purpose of the system is to store and manage student data efficiently.

**Functional Requirements**
- Add student records
- View student records
- Delete student records
- Exit the system

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- User-friendly
- Reliable
- Platform independent

---

### 2. System Design
The system is designed as a menu-driven application.

**System Components**
- Student Record Module
- User Interface Module
- Data Storage Module

**Design Nomenclature**
- Student ID
- Student Name
- Student Records

All names and terminologies used in the design are consistent across the system.

---

### 3. Implementation
The system is implemented as a console-based application.

During implementation:
- The user interacts with a menu interface
- Student data is stored logically during program execution
- Each system function performs a specific task such as adding or deleting records

The implementation follows the system design and requirements.

---

### 4. Testing
The system was tested using:
- Valid data inputs
- Invalid data inputs
- Boundary conditions

The system produced correct results during testing.

---

### 5. Deployment
The system can be deployed on any computer system with basic software requirements.

---

### 6. Maintenance
Future maintenance may include:
- Enhancing system security
- Adding data persistence
- Improving system performance
- Updating system features

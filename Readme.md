## Project Description

This repository contains my SDLC-based project submission and a simple Python implementation example. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate my understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) while also showing a basic practical implementation using Python.

For this project, I selected a Student Management System as my case study for explaining the SDLC. I carefully went through each phase of the SDLC, including Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. In each phase, I explained what happens, why the phase is important, and how it applies to the chosen project.

As part of the implementation phase, I wrote a simple Python program that displays “Hello, World”. This program serves as a basic implementation example to show how system designs are translated into executable instructions using a programming language. The Python code was used alongside the SDLC documentation to illustrate the practical aspect of software development.

All documentation and the implementation example were organized and uploaded to this GitHub repository as required for submission.
